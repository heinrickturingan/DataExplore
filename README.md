# DataExplore
My project for data exploration.


<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
I am a student at NSCC taking Business Intelligence and Analytics attempting to create a project that will serve as one of my portfolios to show my progress and my adventure on BI and Analytics.
</p>

<h2> Obstacle </h2>
<p>
It is always a challenge to me on choosing a Dataset to present. I've look at numerous sites like Kaggle, UCI Machine, Canada Opendata, Data.gov and a lot more to name. I'm thinking of choosing a dataset about the impact of gadget use to the performance of students, also a dataset about influence of oneâ€™s hobby on selecting a career. 
</p>
<p>
I will continue my search and hope to find a dataset that will tickle my interest.
For now I have my eyes on "Impact of Electronic Gadget on students performance" and "Sleep Efficiency Dataset".
</p>

<h2> Objective </h2>
<p>
My objective is to create a template that can be use as a guide for creating a project that one can present to employers on applying for Data Analytics or Business Intelligence kind of job.
</p>
