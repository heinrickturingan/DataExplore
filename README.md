# DataExplore
My project for data exploration.


<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
I am a student at NSCC taking Business Intelligence and Analytics attempting to create a project that will serve as one of my portfolios to show my progress and my adventure on BI and Analytics.
</p>

<h2> Obstacle </h2>
<p>
It is always a challenge to me on choosing a Dataset to present. I've look at numerous sites like Kaggle, UCI Machine, Canada Opendata, Data.gov and a lot more to name. I'm thinking of choosing a dataset about the impact of gadget use to the performance of student, also a dataset about influence of oneâ€™s hobby on selecting a career. 
</p>
<p>
I will continue my search and hope to find a dataset that will tickle my interest.
For now I have my eyes on "Impact of Electronic Gadget on students performance" and "Sleep Efficiency Dataset".
</p>

<h2> Objective </h2>
<p>
My objective is to create a template that can be use as a guide for creating a project that one can present to employers on applying for Data Analytics or Business Intelligence kind of job. I sm currently having a problem as my columns are not categorize yet and most are numerical. I am looking on how to change the numeric data and make them all category like dimension type.
</p>

<h2> Plan </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Clean the dataset and load it to a CSV.</li>
          <li>Perform EDA to get an idea on what to show in my report.</li>
      </ul>
  <li>SSMS</li>
      <ul>
          <li>o	Create Dimension and Fact table to form my star schema.</li>
      </ul>
  <li>power BI</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Create the final report.</li>
      </ul>
</ul>

<h2> To Do </h2>
<p>
I am planning to create a report that will compare cretain features, like Caffeine consumption and Alcohol consumption to Awakenings, Sleep efficiency of a person who smokes compare to a non-smoker. I am having struggle with my columns are they are numeric and I needed it too be categorical or in dimension type for my to use it on a graph.

<h3> About Dataset </h3>
<p> 
The dataset contains information about a group of test subjects and their sleep patterns. Each test subject is identified by a unique "Subject ID" and their age and gender are also recorded. The "Bedtime" and "Wakeup time" features indicate when each subject goes to bed and wakes up each day, and the "Sleep duration" feature records the total amount of time each subject slept in hours. The "Sleep efficiency" feature is a measure of the proportion of time spent in bed that is actually spent asleep. The "REM sleep percentage", "Deep sleep percentage", and "Light sleep percentage" features indicate the amount of time each subject spent in each stage of sleep. The "Awakenings" feature records the number of times each subject wakes up during the night. Additionally, the dataset includes information about each subject's caffeine and alcohol consumptions in the 24 hours prior to bedtime, their smoking status, and their exercise frequency.
